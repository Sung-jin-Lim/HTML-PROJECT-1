    <p>
      Keanu Charles Reeves (/kiˈɑːnuː/ kee-AH-noo;[4][5][6] born September 2,
      1964) is a Canadian[b] actor. Born in Beirut and raised in Toronto, Reeves
      began acting in theatre productions and in television films before making
      his feature film debut in Youngblood (1986). He had his breakthrough role
      in the science fiction comedy Bill & Ted's Excellent Adventure (1989), and
      he later reprised his role in its sequels. He gained praise for playing a
      hustler in the independent drama My Own Private Idaho (1991), and
      established himself as an action hero with leading roles in Point Break
      (1991) and Speed (1994). Following several box office failures, Reeves's
      performance in the horror film The Devil's Advocate (1997) was well
      received. Greater stardom came for playing Neo in the science fiction
      series The Matrix, beginning in 1999. He played John Constantine in
      Constantine (2005) and starred in the romantic drama The Lake House
      (2006), the science fiction thriller The Day the Earth Stood Still (2008),
      and the crime thriller Street Kings (2008). Following a setback, Reeves
      made a comeback by playing the titular assassin in the John Wick film
      series, beginning in 2014. In addition to acting, Reeves has directed the
      film Man of Tai Chi (2013). He has played bass guitar for the band Dogstar
      and pursued other endeavours such as writing and philanthropy.

              <h3>John Wick</h3>
              <p>
                John Wick is an American neo-noir action-thriller media
                franchise created by screenwriter Derek Kolstad and owned by
                Lionsgate. Keanu Reeves plays John Wick, a retired hitman
                seeking vengeance for the killing of the dog given to him by his
                recently deceased wife and the theft of his car. The franchise
                began with the release of John Wick in 2014 followed by two
                sequels, John Wick: Chapter 2 on February 10, 2017, and John
                Wick: Chapter 3 – Parabellum on May 17, 2019. All three films
                were considered critical and commercial successes, accumulating
                a collective gross of more than $587 million worldwide. A fourth
                installment, John Wick: Chapter 4, is in pre-production and has
                a release date of May 27, 2022.[1][2][3] A fifth installment is
                also in development, and was intended be shot back-to-back with
                the fourth film before Lionsgate decided not to go with that
                plan.[4]
